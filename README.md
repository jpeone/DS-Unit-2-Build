# DS-Unit-2-Build
Companion notebooks to the high-level analysis is on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jesse.gene.peone/napkin-math-with-bosch-23e9aedb0c41?sk=a62251575cae5ef40bdf5638b6c26af4)  

## How to read
```main_analysis.ipynb``` is the best notebook for an overview. Use the 
hypothesis testing grid to guide you through the ```wrangle``` notebooks. 
```aidditional_visualizations``` note books contain some explanatory graphs of
a few features.

## Setting up
[Download](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bosch-production-line-performance/data) and extract the data set to this directory.
Optionally you may want to create a directory titled ```wrangled-sets/``` if you intend to run the wrangling notebooks.

## How to run
Run notebooks in this order:

1. ```wrangle_1_megaset.ipynb```
2. ```wrangle_2_metafeature_pca_date.ipynb```
3. ```wrangle_3_explore_categoricals.ipynb```
4. ```wrangle_4_meatfeature_cat_pred_proba.ipynb```
5. ```main_analysis.ipynb```
6. ```additional_visualizations_l1_s25.ipynb```
7. ```additional_visualizations_l3_s32.ipynb```
